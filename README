README file for Perl extension XML::SAX::ExpatXS
================================================

This module is an XS only implementation of PerlSAX2 parser
using Expat. XML::SAX::Expat is currently implemented as a layer 
over XML::Parser.

This module has been created by Matt Sergeant reusing some
files from XML::Parser. The current maintainer is Petr Cimprich
<petr AT gingerall DOT cz>.

It's still not entirely complete. Thought it should work for most
people's uses, please consider the current version beta for 
evaluation purposes. Feedback of any kind would be appreciated.

These PerlSAX callbacks are supported and tested so far:

 start_document()
 end_document()
 start_element()
 end_element()
 characters()
 processing_instruction()
 comment()
 start_dtd()
 end_dtd()
 start_prefix_mapping()
 end_prefix_mapping()
 start_cdata()
 end_cdata()
 notation_decl()

(Some other may work as well but hasn't been tested positively yet.)

This one is deprecated but works:

 xml_decl()

Major items to be done ASAP:

 locator interface
 error handling
